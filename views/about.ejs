      <h1>About Daily Planet</h1>
        <p>So Ann, the question is, do you want a man or a boy? I know how I would answer. Heyyyy uncle father Oscar. What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese? One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. Buster, you remember when we were kissing last night? Buster: It was a wild, wild ride.</p>

        <p>Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter. Each year, Oscar attempts the four hundred mile walk from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California. In the twelve years that he's attempted this, he's never made it farther than UC Irvine. Of course. The "Bob Loblaw Law Blog." Wow. You, sir, are a mouthful! Also, your knee is on my heart. Tobias Fünke costume. I am going to my spin class. I thought you had vertigo. I never thought I'd miss a hand so much!</p>
