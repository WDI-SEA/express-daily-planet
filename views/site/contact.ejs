<p>Do I really look like a guy with a plan, Harvey?</p>

<p>I don’t have a plan …</p>

<p>The mob has plans. The cops have plans.</p>

<p>You know what I am, Harvey? I am a dog chasing cars… I wouldn’t know what to do with one if I caught it.</p>

<p>I just do things. I am just the wrench in the gears. I hate plans.</p>

<p>Yours, theirs, everyone’s. Maroni has plans. Gordon has plans.</p>

<p>Schemers trying to control their worlds.</p>

<p>I am not a schemer. I show the schemer how pathetic their attempts to control things really are.</p>

<p>So when I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal, you know I am telling the truth.</p>

<p>I just did what I do best. I took your plan and turned it on itself.</p>

<p>Look what I have done to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets.</p>

<p>Nobody panics when the expected people gets killed. Nobody panics when things go according to plan, even if the plan is horrifying.</p>

<p>If I tell the press that tomorrow a gangbanger will get shot or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics. – because it’s all part of the plan.</p>

<p>But when I say that one little old mayor will die, everybody lose their minds.</p>

<p>Introduce a little anarchy, you upset the established order and everything becomes chaos.</p>

<p>I am agent of chaos.</p>

<p>And you know the thing about chaos Harvey?</p>

<p>“IT is FAIR.”</p>
